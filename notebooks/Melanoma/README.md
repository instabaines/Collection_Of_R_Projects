## Melanoma EDA
The task involves the exploratiry data analysis on the melanoma dataset.
The data consists of measurements made on patients with
malignant melanoma. Each patient had their tumour removed by surgery at the Depart-
ment of Plastic Surgery, University Hospital of Odense, Denmark during the period 1962
to 1977. The surgery consisted of complete removal of the tumour together with about
2.5cm of the surrounding skin. Among the measurements taken were the thickness of the
tumour and whether it was ulcerated or not. These are thought to be important prog-
nostic variables in that patients with a thick and/or ulcerated tumour have an increased
chance of death from melanoma.
